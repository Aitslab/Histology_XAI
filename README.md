# From Pixels to Pathology: Explainable CNNs in Lung Tissue Analysis

This repository accompanies the manuscript **_“From Pixels to Pathology: Explainable CNNs in Lung Tissue Analysis.”_**

This work is a continuation of our previous manuscript (ref), focusing on:

- **Numerical analysis** of deep learning models for lung tissue classification  
- **Explainable AI (XAI) algorithms** to connect pathology-driven features with model-driven representations  

The goal of this study is to enhance interpretability and transparency in CNN-based lung pathology analysis by bridging computational features with domain-specific pathology insights.
